This repository is used to develop a *macOS only* codebase for an OpenSim compatible viewer. 

The repository is a refinement of a fork of the Kokua viewer which was made at the point in
2015 just before Linden Labs removed support for curl from the viewer, and added the http coroutines. 

That fork is called Dayturn and is the base to develop a generic viewer for connecting to OpenSim grids
and standalone instances leaving out SecondLife specific functionality. 
Dayturn exists in https://bitbucket.org/dayturn/dayturn

Because of the complexity of having a shared codebase for Linux, macOS and Windows, the code in this
repository has been stripped of all Windows and Linux specifics and is only suitable for a macOS version
of the viewer. 

Increasingly as many of the opensource libraries as possible will be replaced with Apple frameworks or
the system supplied versions of opensource libraries, both because they often are richer in functionality,
significantly better tested, in many cases highly optimized for Apple hardware, and provides better compatibility
across operating system versions, and when new hardware is introduced. 
This will of course break compatibility with Linux and Windows versions at the source-level and to a lesser degree
at the functionality level. 

This version of the viewer does not have the so-called SecondLife Jelly Dolls. 

Support for the Linden Lab version 2.0 rigging and skeleton, Bento, in addition to Linden Lab Animated Mesh was 
added in 2018.

This version of the viewer does currently not have support for Marine Kelly's RLV.

Now that the support for "legacy" assets has been removed from SecondLife, the code for the SecondLife unified 
marketplace and pathfinding will be removed, in addition to numerous other SecondLife tie-ins and functionality 
that don't apply to OpenSim users or grids.
