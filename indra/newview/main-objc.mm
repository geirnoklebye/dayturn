int main(int argc, char * argv[]) 
{
    return NSApplicationMain(argc, (const char**)argv);
}

// argc is a counter to the number of arguments given to the program when started with the terminal open command.
// argv is an array of char pointers holding the arguments given. 
// The first entry in argv is always the name of the command itself, meaning that argc will always be 1.
